# Animal Sounds

This sample app accompanies the article: **A/B Testing with ConfigCat and Google Analytics.**

The app is a quiz where users listen to an animal sound and then choose the correct animal name from four options. The quiz app was built using Vue.js.

Weâ€™re running an A/B test to see if highlighting the answer will encourage users to play more.
